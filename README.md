# CarInformation

The "Car Info" Android app is a simple and easy-to-use tool that displays information about various cars, including images, descriptions, prices, and engine types. The app is powered by a real-time Firebase database, enabling easy updating and management of car information. The app consists of two activities, with the first activity displaying a list of available cars and the second activity displaying detailed information about a selected car.
